Material Me!
MaterialMe (Not Graded) AJT 2020

Open the MaterialMe app.
 - Create a shared element transition between the MainActivity and the DetailActivity, with the banner image for the sport as the shared element.
 - Clicking on a list item in the MaterialMe app triggers the transition. The banner image from the card moves to the top of the screen in the detail view.
